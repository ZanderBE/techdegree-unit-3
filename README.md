# Techdegree Project 3: Online Registration Form

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below:

- For this project we will be checking the design in Google Chrome version 48 or higher.
- Use the supplied mockup files to build a mobile-ready registration form.
- Use a mobile-first approach: make sure the basic design (without media queries) matches the mobile design in the mobile-form.png.
- Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see the project resources for links to "Using the viewport meta tag" and "Configuring the Viewport".
- Use CSS media queries to change the layout of the form at screen widths of 760 pixels or wider, to match the desktop design in the desktop-form.png file.
- Make sure you include the following form field types:
	•	text input
	•	email input
	•	telephone input
	•	select menu
	•	checkboxes
	•	radio buttons
	•	textfield
	•	submit button
- Use descriptive names for the form inputs -- for example, "email" for the email field, not "e" or "xyz."
- Add labels to the form fields using the HTML <label> tag
- Use the input field's placeholder attribute to add "required" to:
	•	the Full Name field
	•	the Email address field
- Make sure you properly pair <label> elements with form controls via the for attribute.
- Add "focus" states to the form for when a user clicks or tabs into a text field.
- Add two fieldsets and legends for the:
	•	"Contact Information" section of the page, and
	•	The "Newsletter" section of the page.
  
## Brief Summary of my project

## Grade Received:
Exceeds Expectations.
